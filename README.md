# StrikeDipC
Strike And Dip device with code written for the Arduino IDE

This repo will contain the code, build instructions, gerbers, BOM, and anything else required for building a automagic strike and dip reader for geological mapping.  Although this project uses an Adafruit Feather M0, the code in this repository will be written for the Arduino IDE.
